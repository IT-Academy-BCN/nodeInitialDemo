### GITFLOW

Uses two branches: main and develop.
Main: official release history
Develop: integration branch for features


```
git branch develop
git push -u origin develop
```

Feature branches use develop as their parent branch. When a feature is complete, it gets merged back into develop. Features should never interact directly with main.
